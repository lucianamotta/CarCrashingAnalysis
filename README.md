# CarCrashingAnalysis
Repository containing files of my Final Project in the Machine Learning Course.

1. Introduction and discovery
The organization responsible for this dataset is New York Police Department – NYPD.
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC from January 2016 until December 2022.
Every traffic crash is electronically registered in a Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS), and one dataset is saved in Department’s crime data warehouse, which can be used for future safety analyses.
To construct the model was used a sample with records from January 2021 until December 2022.

1.1. The problem
The main objective is to identify patterns in the collision crashes dataset. For example: Is there a determined car type that has more chance of being involved in a car crash, in which neighborhoods have more collisions? Is there a relation between the hour and the car crash happening? And about the number of people injured.
In the future, the NYPD can use these insights to produce strategies to reduce the number of accidents, such conscientization campaign, improved signalization, installation of electronic radars in strategic locations, and improvement the inspection methods.
1.2. Initial hypotheses
The initial hypothesis was that Inadequate Driver Behavior and Use of electronic devices could be the main factors in car accidents.
Besides could have neighbors where car accidents are more frequent.
